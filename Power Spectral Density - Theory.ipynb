    "A thorough introduction to **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** for a signal, building up from elementary components - **Energy**, **Power**, **Autocorrelation**. The motivation behind the **Einstein-Wiener-Khintchine Theorem** is explored. The **Periodogram** as an estimate for the PSD is introduced. This notebook takes care to make clear distinctions between **signals** and **systems** at every step, a lack of which, in most popular references, introduces ambiguity."
