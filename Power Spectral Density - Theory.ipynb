    "**Note**: *I have not included the proof of the above in the interest of space. It relies on interchanging the order of the expectation operator with the summation and thus relating the expected value of the output to the expected value of the input multiplied by a delayed version of itself i.e. the auto-correlation of the input. Interested readers may find the complete proof in Oppenheim and Verghese (Oppenheim & Verghese, 2017, eq. 10.62, 10.66, 10.68).
